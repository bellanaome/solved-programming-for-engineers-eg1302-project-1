<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="Programming for Engineers (EG1302) PROJECT # 1 Solution">Write a program that prompts the user for any year higher or equal to 1900 and prints its monthly calendar. The calendar runs through the entire year displaying each month in a format that looks like the following:February 1992Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa12 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 20 21 2223 24 25 26 27 28 29

Task 1: Your program must display the data in a form in which everything lines upcorrectly on the screen. Your program should be able to determine the day of the week when the first day of the month starts. To determine the first day of the month for a given year, you need to mark a reference day in history and count from that date. For this, useJanuary 1, 1900, which fell on a Monday. For every year since then, you need to add 365 or 366 days, depending on whether the year was a leap year.Note: A year is a leap year if one of the following conditions hold: The year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or The year is divisible by 400.Task 2: Give the user the option to print the calendar with one month per row, twomonths per row, or three months per row.Example of one-month per row calendar:January 2005Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa12 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 20 21 2223 24 25 26 27 28 2930 31February 2005Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 10 11 1213 14 15 16 17 18 1920 21 22 23 24 25 2627 28Example of two-month per row calendar:January 2005 February 2005Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa1 1 2 3 4 52 3 4 5 6 7 8 6 7 8 9 10 11 129 10 11 12 13 14 15 13 14 15 16 17 18 1916 17 18 19 20 21 22 20 21 22 23 24 25 2623 24 25 26 27 28 29 27 2830 31Example of three-months per row:January 2005 February 2005 March 2005Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa1 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 52 3 4 5 6 7 8 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 6 7 8 9 10 11 129 10 11 12 13 14 15 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 13 14 15 16 17 18 1916 17 18 19 20 21 22 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 20 21 22 23 24 25 2623 24 25 26 27 28 29 27 28 27 28 29 30 3130 31
